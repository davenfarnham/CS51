- pattern matching
	- in the pattern match, if there's a constant 
	 in the pattern, if it matches the pattern in the 
	 expression v pass on the expression e in the (p, e) 
	 tuple.

	- if the pattern = Data_p ("None", []) and v = Data_e ("None", [])
	  then the constructors will match and the lists will be empty; 
	  so go ahead and eval the expression e. (323)
