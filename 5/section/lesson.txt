(1) Start by talking about crawler
    - mention what sets are, what dictionaries are, the different functions and types in CrawlerServices
    
(2) Open up section5.ml
    - go over Nodeset
        - open up myset.ml and go over the set module, comparable module, and ListSet, which is basically
          exactly what students are supposed to do except with a dictionary.

    - go over how to use a functor to create a data structure from another data structure (functor.ml). Make
      sure to point out how you're passing in the comparable module, and then using C.t as the elt. In order to 
      successfully return a Set module, all the types and functions inside Set have to be matched and handled 
      by the functor.

    - in the pset, for part 2, instead of implementing a set using a list, or, like we just did, using a Queue, 
      you'll instead be using a dictionary. So what is a dictionary?
      
    - go over dictionary (why we are doing part 2 [to get ready for 2-3 trees], some of the functions and types in
      the signature, and Dict.make()

(3) Go over graphs a little bit
